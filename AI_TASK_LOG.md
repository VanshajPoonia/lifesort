# AI_TASK_LOG.md

Every AI agent must update this file after making changes to the repo.

This file is the working memory and handoff log. Do not rely on chat history as the source of truth.

## Current Status

LifeSort is a broad Next.js App Router application with many implemented product areas and a Vercel-oriented deployment. The repo now has persistent AI memory files in the project root.

Current verification state:

- `npm run build` passes, but skips type validation and linting through `next.config.mjs`.
- `npm run build` emits Next warnings about unsupported `metadata.themeColor` and `metadata.viewport` fields.
- `npm run lint` fails because no `eslint.config.*` file exists for ESLint 10.
- No test, typecheck, formatter, or database migration runner script is defined in `package.json`.

## Completed Work

### 2026-05-16 12:58 IST - Initial Repo Analysis

- Agent/tool used: Codex.
- Task summary: Deeply inspected the LifeSort repository to prepare persistent AI memory documentation.
- Files changed: none during analysis.
- What changed: No code or documentation changes were made during the planning/analysis phase.
- Commands run:
  - `pwd`
  - `rg --files -g '!*node_modules*' -g '!*.png' -g '!*.jpg' -g '!*.jpeg' -g '!*.gif' -g '!*.ico' -g '!*.webp'`
  - `git status --short`
  - Targeted `sed` inspections of `package.json`, `README.md`, `lib/auth.ts`, `lib/db.ts`, `next.config.mjs`, `vercel.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `components/dashboard-layout.tsx`, `app/globals.css`, representative API routes, and schema files.
  - Targeted `rg` searches for env vars, SQL schema usage, route handlers, state management, TODO/risk markers, and UI/auth/database patterns.
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run build`
- Verification results:
  - `npm run build` passed and generated all routes, but skipped type validation and linting.
  - `npm run build` warned that `metadata.themeColor` and `metadata.viewport` should move to viewport exports.
  - `npm run lint` failed because ESLint could not find `eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs)`.
- Remaining issues:
  - No AI memory docs existed at the time of analysis.
  - Linting is not configured for the installed ESLint major version.
  - Build is not enforcing type or lint checks.
  - Schema scripts show drift; `scripts/website-current-schema.sql` appears closest to canonical.
- Next recommended task: Create the five root AI memory docs and rerun the agreed verification commands.
- Handoff prompt for next agent: "Create `AGENTS.md`, `AI_PROJECT.md`, `AI_TASK_LOG.md`, `AI_DECISIONS.md`, and `AI_CHECKLIST.md` using only repo facts from the inspection. Do not modify product code. After writing the docs, run `git status --short`, `npm run build`, and `npm run lint`, then update `AI_TASK_LOG.md` with the actual results."

### 2026-05-16 12:58 IST - Created AI Memory Documentation

- Agent/tool used: Codex.
- Task summary: Created persistent AI agent memory and workflow documentation in the project root.
- Files changed:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `AI_PROJECT.md`
  - `AI_TASK_LOG.md`
  - `AI_DECISIONS.md`
  - `AI_CHECKLIST.md`
- What changed:
  - Added agent operating instructions, project overview, work log, decision record, and verification checklist.
  - Captured repo-specific architecture, commands, product scope, known risks, and handoff rules.
  - Documented current verification gaps without changing app behavior.
- Commands run:
  - `git status --short`
  - `ls AGENTS.md AI_PROJECT.md AI_TASK_LOG.md AI_DECISIONS.md AI_CHECKLIST.md`
  - `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run lint`
- Verification results:
  - `git status --short` showed only the five new untracked documentation files.
  - `npm run build` passed, compiled successfully, generated 65 static pages, skipped type validation, skipped linting, and emitted the known Next metadata warnings for `themeColor` and `viewport`.
  - `npm run lint` failed before source linting because ESLint 10.3.0 could not find `eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs)`.
  - Documentation was written with environment variable names only; no `.env.local` secret values were copied.
- Remaining issues:
  - Existing lint configuration failure remains.
  - Existing build warnings remain.
  - No tests/typecheck script exists.
- Next recommended task: Add an ESLint flat config and a typecheck script, then decide whether to re-enable build validation.
- Handoff prompt for next agent: "Read all root AI memory files first. The safest next technical cleanup is to make `npm run lint` work with ESLint 10 and add a non-mutating `typecheck` script. Preserve existing app behavior."

## Current Work

No active in-progress task is recorded after this documentation update.

## Proposed Next Work

- Add an ESLint flat config compatible with the installed ESLint version.
- Add `typecheck` and possibly `format` scripts.
- Decide whether `next.config.mjs` should continue skipping build errors and lint errors.
- Normalize auth/session handling in `app/api/calendar/sync/route.ts` and `app/api/investments/parse-screenshot/route.ts`.
- Consolidate database schema/migration guidance around `scripts/website-current-schema.sql`.

## Active Bugs / Issues

- `npm run lint` fails because no `eslint.config.*` file exists.
- `npm run build` passes while skipping type and lint validation.
- Next build warns about unsupported metadata fields.
- Calendar sync route reads `session_id`, not the main `session` cookie.
- Investment screenshot parsing uses a JWT helper with a fallback secret instead of the main session helper.
- URL preview route fetches arbitrary URLs and may need SSRF hardening.

## Architecture Concerns

- Raw SQL is duplicated across many route handlers.
- Schema migration history is spread across many SQL files with overlapping changes.
- Client pages hold large amounts of local state and fetch logic.
- No automated tests currently guard auth, CRUD, sharing, reminders, integrations, or AI routes.

## Testing Status

- No test framework or `test` script is configured.
- No typecheck script is configured.
- Lint script exists but currently fails before checking source files.
- Build passes with warnings and disabled type/lint gates.

## Known Risks

- Secrets must never be copied from `.env.local` into docs or logs.
- Database scripts should not be run without explicit environment confirmation.
- Integration routes rely on external services and API limits.
- Subscription/admin behavior should be changed carefully because it affects account access.

## AI Handoff Summaries

Future agents should start by reading all root memory files, then inspect the relevant code before editing. Keep changes small and update this file after every repo change.

## Future Feature Ideas

Only implement feature ideas when explicitly requested. Possible future ideas inferred from existing scope:

- Stronger reminder scheduling and delivery status.
- More robust integrations dashboard.
- Unified typed API client or shared validation layer.
- Automated import/export or backup flows.

## Open Questions

- Which SQL files have actually been applied to production?
- Is `scripts/website-current-schema.sql` fully synchronized with the live database?
- Which AI provider configuration is expected for the `ai` SDK model names in production?
- Should the app standardize on pnpm commands in README and docs?
- Should auth fully migrate to opaque session tokens everywhere?
